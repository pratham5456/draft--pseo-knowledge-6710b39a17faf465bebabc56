                <p>Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) allow high school students to take college courses and earn credits before they graduate. Understanding the credit transfer policies associated with PSEO is crucial for students and parents.

                <h2>What Are Credit Transfer Policies?</h2>

            
                <p>Credit transfer policies are rules and guidelines established by colleges and universities that dictate how credits earned at one institution can be applied toward a degree at another institution. These policies can vary significantly between schools, making it essential for PSEO students to be informed about them.</p>

            
                <h3>Importance of Credit Transfer Policies</h3>

                <h3>Institutional Policies</h3>
