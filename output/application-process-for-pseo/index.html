<h3>General Eligibility</h3>
<p>To participate in PSEO, students must be in grades 10, 11, or 12. Each educational institution may have specific GPA requirements, so it’s important to check with the college or university you are interested in.</p>
<h3>Academic Readiness</h3>
<p>Students must demonstrate readiness for college-level coursework. This can be assessed through standardized test scores, teacher recommendations, or previous academic performance. It’s crucial to prepare these documents ahead of time to streamline the application process.</p>

            
                <h2>Application Steps</h2>
<p>The application process for PSEO can be broken down into several key steps.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Research Institutions</h3>

<h3>Step 2: Complete the Application Form</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Submit Required Documents</h3>

<h3>Step 4: Follow Up</h3>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
