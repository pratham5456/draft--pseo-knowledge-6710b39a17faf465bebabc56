                <p>PSEO is generally available to high school juniors and seniors. However, some programs may allow younger students to participate if they demonstrate exceptional academic capabilities. Understanding the specific age and grade requirements of each institution is crucial for prospective PSEO students.</p>

            
                <h2>Application Process for PSEO</h2>

            
                <h3>Steps to Apply</h3>

Students should carefully follow the instructions provided by the participating college or university to ensure a smooth application process.</p>

            
                <h3>Important Deadlines</h3>

            
                <p>It&#39;s essential for students and families to be aware of application deadlines for PSEO programs.
